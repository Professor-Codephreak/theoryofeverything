Experimental Designs
1️⃣ Enhanced Casimir Effect Measurement – $1,000
Objective:
Detect vacuum energy deviations due to the quantized nature of spacetime by measuring anomalies in the Casimir force.

Principle:
The Casimir effect arises from quantum fluctuations in the vacuum between two closely spaced, uncharged conductive plates. If spacetime is discrete, small deviations in this force could emerge.

Required Materials:
Two gold-coated conductive plates (high precision, polished) → $200
Piezoelectric actuator (for nanometer-scale plate positioning) → $200
Laser interferometer (for precise displacement measurements) → $400
Vacuum chamber (to eliminate air interference) → $150
Vibration isolation platform → $50
Experimental Procedure:
Place the conductive plates parallel to each other in a vacuum chamber.
Use a piezoelectric actuator to adjust the distance between plates with nanometer precision.
Employ a laser interferometer to measure small shifts caused by the Casimir force.
Record the force at various separations and compare it to theoretical predictions.
Identify anomalies that could indicate spacetime discreteness.

Experimental Procedure:
Suspend a lightweight beam from a quartz torsion fiber.

Analyze data for non-Newtonian deviations that could signal extra dimensions.
3️⃣ High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection – $5,000
Objective:
