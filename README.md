# Theory of Everything (ToE)

A computational implementation of a Grand Unified Theory of Everything, unifying all fundamental forces and matter interactions into a single coherent mathematical framework.

## Overview

The Theory of Everything (ToE) is an ambitious project that combines advanced physics concepts from quantum field theory, general relativity, particle physics, and cosmology with computational visualization techniques to explore and demonstrate the mathematical structure of the universe.

The project provides:
- Mathematical formulations of all fundamental physical interactions
- Interactive visualizations of complex physics concepts
- Symbolic representation and manipulation of equations
- Tools for exploring the unified theory and its implications

## ðŸ”­ Unified Action: Master Equation

The total action $S$ is composed of four main parts:

$$
S = S_{\text{gravity}} + S_{\text{matter}} + S_{\text{gauge}} + S_{\text{quantum}}
$$

Where:
- $S_{\text{gravity}}$ â†’ Quantum gravity action
- $S_{\text{matter}}$ â†’ Matter field action
- $S_{\text{gauge}}$ â†’ Gauge field (force) action
- $S_{\text{quantum}}$ â†’ Quantum corrections

Disclaimer: these formulas are over my head. I think about infinity and gravity and space time but the Grand Unified Theory of Everything has been created by Professor Codephreak, an AI agent. Someone smarter than me needs to verify this or laugh at this project and declare it a toy. contact me on linkedin for information about where to send the nobel prize ;-)
